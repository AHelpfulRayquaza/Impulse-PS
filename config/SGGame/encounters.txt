SGgame - Encounters
This file holds raw data for wild pokemon encounters in SGgame
The following is an example of a layout of wild pokemon appearences in a specific zone. Messages in {} braces are information about the example, not part of the example

LOCATION LOCATION|ZONE {the location id and zone id number seperated with a | ex: mainisland|0}
TYPE ENCOUNTER_TYPE {The method the player needs to use to support an encounter with the following pokemon ex: GRASS.}
{Accepted values for the Encounter Type are: GRASS (tall grass), WATER (surfing), CAVE (walking in a cave), FISH (fishing), more may be added}
species,level {A pokemon that can appear and the level that it appears at ex: lotad,5}
species,min-level,max-level {A pokemon that can appear and the range of levels it can appear at (inclusive) ex: lotad,3,5}
species,min-level,max-level,count {Instead of writing multiple lines for a species to increase how common it is, use count to duplicate the line so that there are "count" lines for the line selected when parsed}
{count modifies the rate of appearence for a pokemon, so if you have a count of 2 on pidgy, and 3 on sentret, theres a 40% chance of finding pidgy, and 60% chance of finding sentret}
{to have a pokemon only appear at a specific level and have a count, set min and max level to the same level}
{you CAN have multiple of a pokemon species id in one location|zone's encounter type, this can be used to have different chances for appearences at different levels}
{ex:}
bidoof,5,6
bidoof,2,4,5
